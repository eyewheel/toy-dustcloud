This is a binary visualization tool inspired by the work behind Battelle's [CantorDust](https://github.com/Battelle/cantordust), as explained further in their blogpost at [https://inside.battelle.org/blog-details/battelle-publishes-open-source-binary-visualization-tool]. 
If you want a binary visualizer for any actual use, use CantorDust; this is a personal project to see how much data can be extracted from a file using only the "digraph plotting" on the bytes, 
and whether it can run in one Python script.
